## Introduction
{:toc}
This guide provides foundational knowledge of CubeSat system architecture and software, tailored for new OBC team members.


## Role and Responsibilities of the OBC Team
{:toc}
The Onboard Computer (OBC) serves as the CubeSat’s central command center, coordinating subsystems, managing mission-critical tasks, and ensuring seamless data flow throughout the satellite. 
- It processes attitude data from the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) and issues control commands to maintain and adjust the CubeSat’s orientation. 
- The OBC is responsible for controlling deployment mechanisms, including antennas and burner circuits for solar panel deployment, ensuring the satellite’s functionality post-launch. 
- It manages power line regulation and protection by controlling Digital Input/Outputs (DIOs) and Overcurrent Protection Systems (OCPS) and 
- handles connections to communication transceivers to facilitate telemetry, command, and mission data exchange between the CubeSat and the ground station. 

Additionally, the OBC oversees mission routing, ensuring that tasks like data acquisition, storage, and downlink operations occur according to mission schedules, making it an indispensable component of CubeSat operations.
