## *So, you want to build a satellite?*


### *Introduction*

We are creating an environment for sharing knowledge and ideas.

By using the Open Source Satellite platform as the means to advance the next phase of low-cost, high-capability satellite missions, we hope to pique interest and increase access to information that will inspire the next generation of mission creators and end users.

To help you create your own open source satellite mission, we are building a library of resources that will cover the entire mission lifetime from start to finish. 

If you would want to contribute to or work with the birds-project.com community in order to assist develop the solution, please get in touch with us.

### *What is BIRDS-OSP?*

The BIRDS Open Source Project is a group of resources aimed at educational institutions and space agencies in emerging space faring nations interested in developing the capacity of their locality.

The aim is to get as many countries as possible into the space race.

BIRDS-OSP offers teaching guids, tutorials, and design, manufacturing and procedural documents to help you get a satellite into space.

BIRDS-OSP is free and transparent. The source files for all past flight heritage can be found on [Github].

BIRDS-OSP is an intiative of LaSiene, a labotaotry out of Kyushu Institute of Technology.


### *Mission*
Experience the entire cycle of a satellite project, from mission definition to operation, in a hands-on manner.

Have a strategy for sustainability after the training ends.

It should be emphasized that the primary goal is not the building of a satellite, but to have a long-term and sustainable space program established in each member country.=


### *Requirements*

What does it take to build and launch a satellite?

- `Money` - how to fund it

- `Tools and Materials` - where to buy parts

- `Testing facilities` - where to verify and validate your finished products.[^1]
  
-  `Scheduling` - how long will it take to build a satellite with the resources you have at your disposal?

*Your responsibilities as a user*


### *Getting Started*

Once you've read through the introduction and yoou definitelyunderstand, you can check out the [README] on the next steps to take.
