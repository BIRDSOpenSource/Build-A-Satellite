# *So, you want to build a satellite?*


### *Introduction*

We are creating an environment for sharing knowledge and ideas.

By using the Open Source Satellite platform as the means to advance the next phase of low-cost, high-capability satellite missions, we hope to pique interest and increase access to information that will inspire the next generation of mission creators and end users.

To help you create your own open source satellite mission, we are building a library of resources that will cover the entire mission lifetime from start to finish. 

If you would want to contribute to or work with the birds-project.com community in order to assist develop the solution, please get in touch with us.
