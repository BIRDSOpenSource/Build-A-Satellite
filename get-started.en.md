# *Get Started*

{: .caution }
We are currently in the process of updating much of our training content referencing documents from the BIRDS-X satellite.


The content on this site is divided into several sections, each of which is focused on building skills in a particular subsystem. As the sections are topic-based, each will go through steps for the entire satellite life cycle regarding that subsystem.

   
   The [Background] page first introduces you to the systems engineering satellite development process and the BIRDS satellite bus itself before moving on to tasks specific to manipulating the BIRDS Bus. 
   
Afterwards, deeper exploration is given with templates, tutorials, and application demos, which provide a good sense of what a real BIRDS Bus development scenario entails.

What is your role in your satellite project?
